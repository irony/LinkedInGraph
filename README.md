LinkedInGraph
=============

Gathers all your connections from LinkedIn and finds which companies you are connected to into a graphical view.

When any of your connections login they will populate the graph even more and you can see which companies you have in common.

The idea here is to take away focus on the persons and rather focus on the companies and therefore make the graph easier to read.

Just labbing - nothing works ;)
